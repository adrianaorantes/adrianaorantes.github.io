        <p>Our project was to create an internal dashboard for the Provisioning team that

        <p>I worked in a team of 4 to create a web application that tracked clean water locations in the user's area. </p>
        <p>This internship was my first experience going through the entire product lifecycle and working on a team outside of a 
          hackathon. I learned invaluable skills such as communication skills and how to go about the planning process of a product. I met

        <p>The spring semester of my freshman year of college, I completed my first college internship at a
          sustainable fashion startup called Dynasty George. During this internship, I researched sustainable mediums 
          for hang tags and banners and wrote a research paper to present to Dynasty. I later used my research to 
          design hang tags and banners that represented the values of the brand.
        </p>
        <p>Being my first internship, I learned so much in a span of a few months. Working firsthand with the founder 
          of the startup, Dynasty, I was able to hear about her experiences and her story. Researching sustainable mediums and presenting my work to Dynasty allowed
          me to build up on my presentation skills and research skills, and creating the designs for the banners was one of my 
          first experiences that introduced me to my passion for designing.

      <p>Going to college I had little to no idea about what the tech world was like, so I began my first  
        semester at Columbia University's School of Engineering with lots of questions. It wasn't until I was selected to participate in a program at my university 
        called JADE that I was able to build my first website, visit various tech companies across New York City, and learn
        about the different possibilites my future could hold.
      </p>
      <p>After JADE, I found that I had really enjoyed front-end development and design. Excited about the future, I applied to the New Technologists
      internship at Microsoft. That summer, I learned so much about frontend, backend, design, and product management. It was a life-changing experience
      and I was able to meet amazing mentors and friends. The following summer I returned to Microsoft as an Explore Intern where I was able
      to learn more about data visualization and backend languages on the Experiences and Devices team.
      </p>
      <p>I am a first generation Salvadoran-American living in New York. Some of my favorite activities include hiking,
        dog-sitting, and eating icecream! <HeartTwoTone twoToneColor="#eb2f96" />
      </p>
      <p>I am currently looking for SWE and/or Design roles for the summer of 2022! If you have any questions, feel free to contact
        me at ao2732@columbia.edu! Thanks :)
